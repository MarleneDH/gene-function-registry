comments: 
  - Overexpression of EcABCC8 (or its orthologs) in transgenic plants created glyphosate resistance. EcABCC8 knockout plants had decreased resistance to glyphosate.
phenotype_synopsis: EcABCC8 codes for an efflux pump that 'extrudes' the herbicide glyphosate out of a cell's cytoplasm, making Echinochloa colona ('awnless barnyardgrass') glyphosate resistant.
