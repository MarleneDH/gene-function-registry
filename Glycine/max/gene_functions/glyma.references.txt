AB  - The major maturity gene E1 has the most prominent effect on flowering time and 
      photoperiod sensitivity of soybean, but the pathway mediated by E1 is largely 
      unknown. Here, we found the expression of GmFT4, a homolog of Flowering Locus T, 
      was strongly up-regulated in transgenic soybean overexpressing E1, whereas 
      expression of flowering activators, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, was suppressed. GmFT4 
      expression was strongly up-regulated by long days exhibiting a diurnal rhythm, 
      but down-regulated by short days. Notably, the basal expression level of GmFT4 
      was elevated when transferred to continous light, whereas repressed when 
      transferred to continuous dark. GmFT4 was primarily expressed in fully expanded 
      leaves. Transcript abundance of GmFT4 was significantly correlated with that of 
      functional E1, as well as flowering time phenotype in different cultivars. 
      Overexpression of GmFT4 delayed the flowering time in transgenic Arabidopsis. 
      Taken together, we propose that GmFT4 acts downstream of E1 and functions as a 
      flowering repressor, and the balance of two antagonistic factors (GmFT4 vs 
      GmFT2a/5a) determines the flowering time of soybean.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is the key flowering integrator in Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana), and its homologs encode florigens in many plant species 
      regardless of their photoperiodic response. Two FT homologs, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, 
      are involved in photoperiod-regulated flowering and coordinately control 
      flowering in soybean. However, the molecular and genetic understanding of the 
      roles played by GmFT2a and GmFT5a in photoperiod-regulated flowering in soybean 
      is very limited. In this study, we demonstrated that GmFT2a and GmFT5a were able 
      to promote early flowering in soybean by overexpressing these two genes in the 
      soybean cultivar Williams 82 under noninductive long-day (LD) conditions. The 
      soybean homologs of several floral identity genes, such as GmAP1, GmSOC1 and 
      GmLFY, were significantly upregulated by GmFT2a and GmFT5a in a redundant and 
      differential pattern. A bZIP transcription factor, GmFDL19, was identified as 
      interacting with both GmFT2a and GmFT5a, and this interaction was confirmed by 
      yeast two-hybridization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The 
      overexpression of GmFDL19 in soybean caused early flowering, and the 
      transcription levels of the flowering identity genes were also upregulated by 
      GmFDL19, as was consistent with the upregulation of GmFT2a and GmFT5a. The 
      transcription of GmFDL19 was also induced by GmFT2a. The results of the 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that GmFDL19 was able to 
      bind with the cis-elements in the promoter of GmAP1a. Taken together, our results 
      suggest that GmFT2a and GmFT5a redundantly and differentially control 
      photoperiod-regulated flowering in soybean through both physical interaction with 
      and transcriptional upregulation of the bZIP transcription factor GmFDL19, 
      thereby inducing the expression of floral identity genes.

AB  - Photoperiodic flowering is one of the most important factors affecting regional 
      adaptation and yield in soybean (Glycine max). Plant adaptation to long-day 
      conditions at higher latitudes requires early flowering and a reduction or loss 
      of photoperiod sensitivity; adaptation to short-day conditions at lower latitudes 
      involves delayed flowering, which prolongs vegetative growth for maximum yield 
      potential. Due to the influence of numerous major loci and quantitative trait 
      loci (QTLs), soybean has broad adaptability across latitudes. Forward genetic 
      approaches have uncovered the molecular basis for several of these major maturity 
      genes and QTLs. Moreover, the molecular characterization of orthologs of 
      Arabidopsis thaliana flowering genes has enriched our understanding of the 
      photoperiodic flowering pathway in soybean. Building on early insights into the 
      importance of the photoreceptor phytochrome A, several circadian clock components 
      have been integrated into the genetic network controlling flowering in soybean: 
      E1, a repressor of FLOWERING LOCUS T orthologs, plays a central role in this 
      network. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in elucidating 
      photoperiodic flowering in soybean, how it contributes to our fundamental 
      understanding of flowering time control, and how this information could be used 
      for molecular design and breeding of high-yielding soybean cultivars.
